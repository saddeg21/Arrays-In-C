# REPEATED DIGITS
- We created an array and indexes stays for the decimal numbers from 0-9.
- Then make use provide us a number and iterate over the digits one by one.
- Every iteration we firstly check if that index is already been filled with 0 and if it not then fill it. Divide number to 10 and assign itself.
- If it is already been filled, then break the while loop. This will prevent us to make number 0 by dividing it.

Then on another condition, 
- We check whether the number is 0 or not. If it is then print false else true. Because 0 means that there was not repeating at iterations.
